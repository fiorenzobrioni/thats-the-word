/**
 * The tick the cards' compositions listen to when something they draw has changed, and what each
 * card last drew.
 *
 * Glance runs `provideGlance` once per session and keeps the composition alive for a while; inside
 * that window `update()` only wakes the composition that is already there, so a model read before
 * `provideContent` would stay as it was. So every redraw bumps this first, and
 * [rememberWidgetModel] reloads on it.
 *
 * Each composition reports the revision it has drawn ([drawn]), so whatever asked for a redraw (the
 * midnight alarm, a receiver) can stay until the cards are drawn ([awaitDrawn]): Glance composes in
 * a worker of the game's process that no job holds awake once the broadcast that asked has ended,
 * and a process left cached may be frozen with the card half drawn.
 *
 * In memory on purpose: a session cannot outlive the process that runs it.
